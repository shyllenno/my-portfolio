  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Currently, I work as a Financial Analyst, I have a Bachelor degree in Economics and a Master degree in Finance, so you might be asking yourself "why he is trying to change his career?" and I am pleased to answer you.</p>

  <p>I have fallen in love with coding as soon as I learnt to code in VBA, around my twenties. Yes, VBA. Spreadsheets are used everywhere, and even more in finance ("tables" everywhere) and Excel takes the lead.</p>

  <p>Learning to code in VBA was a need to achieve more on my daily duties, and of course, to make my life easier. The more I learnt VBA, the more I used it. I started using it to automate spreadsheets, and when I saw, I was creating stand-alone systems on Excel/Access.</p>

  <p>I still use VBA to manage my mailing tasks on Outlook, I even deal with folders and files in Windows, which lately I have been using PowerShell instead.</p>

  <p>VBA was just the starting point for my career in Finance, unfortunately, Excel does not have a good package for statistics, therefore, the market relies on other software programmes to proceed with all the analysis and algorithms creation. I had to learn how to code in MatLab and also in Python and R, even if Python and R are general purpose programming languages, they are massively used in finance as they are free, so I had to learn both just enough to create algorithms.</p>

  <p>Knowing the basics of programming is already phenomenal, being able to do some stuff here and there is amazing, but seeing potential for automation and software creation in everywhere I look at and not being able to do it by myself, it is frustrating, it really bothers me.</p>

  <p>So, that is why I want to become a full time software developer.</p>

  <p>I have decided to learn HTML & CSS first, as great part of the programs nowadays are web-based applications, or at least they have one version already running alongside with their main desktop version, if not, I bet you, they are planning to do it so. I believe the Web applications are the future.</p>
